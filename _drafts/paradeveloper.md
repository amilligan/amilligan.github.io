After I graduated from college I put my computer science degree in a drawer and went back to school for certification as a paramedic.  I spent a couple years working for a metropolitan ambulance company before I pulled my diploma out of that drawer and started my career in software.

Paramedic school is about three thousand hours[1] of combined classroom and practical training.  Some of the required practical time is in various hospital settings during which you have to perform a certain number of procedures, observe a certain number of cardiac arrests, births, drug overdoses, and the like; the remainder is street time, during which you ride as a third member of a crew and work under the critical eye of an experienced medic.  In order to progress you must pass several individual certification exams[2], both written and practical.  Many programs offer instruction part time, and students complete the program over two or three years.  The program I attended took six months to complete; in order to fit the required hours into that time we attended class during the day and practical sessions or field internships during nights and weekends.  It was, as you might imagine, fairly intense.

I learned a lot during that six months.  Now, coming up on two decades later, I still remember a lot of it.  My brain has retained a lot of drug dosages, indications and contraindications, and interactions[3]; I still remember a lot of the causes of non-traumatic chest pain, and how to differentiate them; I still find cardiac physiology and electrocardiography fascinating; I doubt I would have too difficult a time intubating or starting an IV on someone; I remember how to write reports that can stand up to scrutiny in a court of law.  At the same time, I'm certain I've forgotten more than I remember.

In short, paramedics have a fair amount of detailed knowledge on a variety of medical topics, and are capable of performing reasonably sophisticated analysis, diagnosis[4], and treatment of patients in emergency situations.  They act as the eyes, ears, voices, and hands of the physicians and nurses who run hospital emergency departments.




[1] This doesn't include the prerequisite of a minimum of one year of experience as a basic EMT, generally working for a reasonably busy service.  The basic EMT certification requires about 80 hours of training.

[2] Basic Cardial Life Support, Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Pediatric Advanced Life Support, Prehospital Trauma Life Support, you get the idea.

[3] At least, what they were in the mid-90's.

[4] Legally, paramedics never diagnose; only physicians may do that.  However, the term is regularly used in the informal sense to mean "narrow the possibilities down to a subset we can do something about."
