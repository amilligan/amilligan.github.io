title: Learning to software
---

The popularity of accelerated training courses for software has exploded in the past few years, largely in response to the steadily increasing demand for people to fill software development positions, but I think also in response to a desire for a clear career path into professional software development.  Four year college degrees in computer science have not proven to provide the skills needed for development work; many very successful software developers studied something other than computer science, and some didn't complete a college degree.  This has led to a lot of confusion about what it takes to work in software.

I recently read an [interview](http://blog.thinkful.com/post/52143980897) with Avi Flombaum, from the [Flatiron School] (http://flatironschool.com).  One section jumped out at me in particular:

> *Rob*:        Some people have criticized the notion that you can become a developer in 3 months. Some schools are even shorter than that. How do you respond to that? Does 3 months seem like too short a window to make that sort of claim? Or does that seem like an appropriate amount of time?
>
> *Avi*:          I think you become a developer the day you start building something. That happens pretty quickly at Flatiron School. Day 1, they (our students) start building something. After that, they’re a developer, they may not be any good, **but what else does being a developer mean besides building things?**

The final emphasis is mine.  I think many employers who pay the not inconsequential salaries for the developers they hire would want those employees to demonstrate skills beyond "can build things."

> To say that you can’t become a developer in 12 weeks—that’s kind of crazy. To become a great developer, that takes years. But to become an efficient developer, or a productive developer, 8-12 weeks sounds about right.

I think most people would agree it's possible to learn to write software in twelve weeks, just as it's possible to learn to rebuild an engine, play chess, paint with watercolors, or immobilize a dislocated shoulder.  But how long does it take to become a mechanic, a chess master, a painter, or a medical provider?

> Look, what we’re talking about—this isn’t casual—it’s 12 hours a day every day for 12 weeks. It’s like 700 hours of coursework (at Flatiron School). How many Computer Science (CS) classes do you end up actually taking in a 4-year college? 10? And they meet 3 days as week for 2 hours where most of the time you’re sleeping?

Notwithstanding the possibility that some people take their college classes somewhat more seriously than Avi apparently did, invoking the uselessness of a computer science degree is the reddest of herrings.  Most any experienced software developer will tell you that much of the coursework for a CS degree has little direct relevance in professional software development work.

After I graduated from college (with a computer science degree) I shelved my diplomas and worked for a couple years as a street paramedic.  The paramedic school I attended required 3000 hours of combined classroom and practical time over six months, with practical time split between hospital-based clinical rotations and prehospital service-based field internships.  Even after all that, I quickly learned that an encyclopedic knowledge of procedures, protocols, drug dosages, and symptoms, doesn't prepare you to deal with recalcitrant patients, jurisdiction conflicts, burned out partners, angry family members, hospital politics, or the general animosity from your clientelle.  It's not as different from writing software as most people might think.

Fortunately, EMS providers know that new medics are next to useless and pair them with senior medics, often for an internship of a specific length; six months is not uncommon.  The goal of the intern is to show that he or she can learn, and become more than useless, within an acceptable length of time.  Some, even among those who excelled in the classroom, fail to meet this bar.

At the same time, consider that a paramedic's job, while stressful, is reasonably straightforward.  My job was not to heal patients but to deliver them to a hospital quickly, dealing with immediately life threatening issues if possible.  A medic's skills and knowledge are narrow and focused: treatment options are limited; patient interactions are measured in minutes; team size is rarely greater than two.  The processes of diagnosis, repair, recovery, maintenance, and (ideally) prevention, some of which are measured in years, all fall to the various members of the medical community with far, far more knowledge and training.

Contrast this with a software project, on which you cannot simply write up your paperwork, hand off to the hospital, and move on.  Developers need not just build things, but build things that will grow, change, and continue to provide value as they do so.  Developers have to work on teams with other developers, without duplication, misunderstaning, or strife.  Developers need to know about existing tools and libraries for solving problems, as well as how to solve problems that have no existing solution, and how to tell the difference.

To put it another way, after paramedics successfully complete over four times as much coursework as the Flatiron program, field internships, continuing education requirements, and multiple certification exams, they generally make a blue collar wage.  If software development is so easy that we can teach it in just a few months (or less), why do software developers make such high starting salaries.  

> I don’t think that people who criticize (The Flatiron School) like that are really thinking about it carefully.

I think a lot of people have put a great deal of thought into this, and dismissing their concerns with an ad hominem argument fails to provide a solid defense.

I think it's entirely reasonable to say that the Flatiron School provides value, as do other programs like it.  I think it's entirely reasonable to state that these programs open the door into the software industry.  But, the next question we have to answer is how we provide a path from that open door to productivity and success.  Many more mature professions consider education programs -- whether they result in a degree, a certificate, or a license -- to simply be the first step of training, to be followed by significant time doing real work, with dedicated supervision and evaluation, and an increasing level of autonomy based on performance.  These programs -- call them internships, apprenticeships, or whatever you like -- require a significant investment in time and effort, but experience has shown that the value outweighs the cost.  I see no reason to reinvent the wheel.
